### Usage with AI Agents
This framework is designed to be imported and used by AI agents (like Google Gemini) to provide structured, adaptive responses with multi-modal content delivery.

## Development Notes
- `.gitignore` prevents `build` and `node_modules` folders from being committed.
- `package-lock.json` locks dependency versions for reproducible installs.
- Run tests with `CI=true npm test -- --passWithNoTests`.
- Build the production bundle with `npm run build --silent`.
